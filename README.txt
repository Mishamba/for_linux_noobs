hello. this program was created by noob for noobs. to start it enter "./commands (then your command)". this script works, but with some problems. for example:

	if your command has "|" then u need to enter it with double quotes, like this "|".
	
	if thi script can not find smth check it in the internet. also it can be target for command. 

	all "things" that looks like -la u need to enter like that: -la = -l -a

P.S.
if u can change this code and make it better, so please help me.

P.P.S.
sorry for my bad english)
